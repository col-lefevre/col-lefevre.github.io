                            I am a 2nd year Informatics Ph.D. student at the University of California, Irvine, advised

                            Mental Health, studying mental health stigma and its implications for the design of digital
                            mental health technologies.

                            research, studying how to design technologies to support health and wellbeing in everyday
                            settings.
